Time to start using grep. (makes hunting for the flag a lot easier)

Grep ->
The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. 
The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for globally search for regular expression and print out).

USE -> man grep 
To find out more

***Challenge Statement***
Use grep to find the flag present in the file
