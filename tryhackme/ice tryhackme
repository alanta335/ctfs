command allows us to dump all of the password hashes stored on the system?
 We won't crack the Administrative password in this case as it's pretty strong

golden_ticket_create
**********
Mimikatz allows us to create what's called a `golden ticket`, allowing us to authenticate anywhere with ease. What command allows us to do this?
Golden ticket attacks are a function within Mimikatz which abuses a component to Kerberos (the authentication system in Windows domains), 
the ticket-granting ticket. 
In short, golden ticket attacks allow us to maintain persistence and authenticate as any user on the domain.

run metasploit

by
As we have the password for the user 'Dark' we can now authenticate to the machine and access it via remote desktop (MSRDP). 
As this is a workstation, we'd likely kick whatever user is signed onto it off if we connect to it, 
however, it's always interesting to remote into machines and view them as their users do. 
If this hasn't already been enabled, we can enable it via the following Metasploit module: `run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp`
